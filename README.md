## Features -

### Partners

- Creating, editing and deleting of Partners.
- Partners can have their 'status' set, depending on how far through the support process they are.

  - "To Ask" - You have not asked this person for support yet.
  - "Asked" - You have asked this person if you can send them a support raising letter.
  - "Letter Sent" - You have sent this person a support raising letter.
  - "Contacted" - You have contacted / followed up with this person regarding the letter.
  - "Pledged" - Person has pledged to support you financially.
